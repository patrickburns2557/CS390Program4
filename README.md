# CS390Program4

This Perl script acts like an interactive rm command.

The script accepts lists of files as arguments, and accepts any wildcard expansions, such as *.txt to input all .txt files.

The script lists each file and asks if you wish to delete it or not, and then lists all indicated  files at the end, asking once more if you're sure if you wish to delete the files.
